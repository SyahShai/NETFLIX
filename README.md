In the ever-evolving world of digital entertainment, Netflix stands out as a global leader in streaming media and video-on-demand services. With a vast library of content, ranging from movies and TV shows to stand-up comedies and children's programming, Netflix caters to a diverse audience worldwide.The Netflix Titles dataset offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse content available on Netflix, a leading global streaming service.  Given the immense popularity of Netflix, analyzing the titles and their attributes provides valuable insights into user preferences and content trends.

The dataset includes extensive details about each title, such as the type (movie or TV show), director, cast, country of origin, date added to Netflix, release year, rating, duration, genres,descriptions and review. With such a vast collection of data, it becomes challenging to manually sift through and analyze the content. Therefore, we aim to utilize data analysis techniques to identify key patterns and trends within the Netflix library.

This study focuses on understanding the composition and characteristics of Netflix's content offerings. By examining this dataset, we can uncover the distribution of various genres, the geographical diversity of content, and the evolution of titles over time. Sentiment analysis will be applied to reviews and descriptions to gauge the audience's reception of different shows and movies. Sentiment analysis will streamline the review analysis process, making it easier to assess public opinion and improve content curation.

To conduct this study, we will analyze data on title IDs, genres, ratings, and reviews. The data, sourced from Netflix's publicly available information, will be processed using advanced data analysis tools like RapidMiner and Tableau. These platforms are renowned for their capabilities in machine learning and data visualization, respectively. RapidMiner simplifies the development of machine learning models, while Tableau excels at presenting insights in a clear, visual format.

The primary objective of this project is to explore how different types of content and user reviews influence viewer engagement and satisfaction. By classifying reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories, we aim to provide a clearer understanding of audience sentiments and their impact on the perception of Netflix titles. This analysis will ultimately help in enhancing the quality and appeal of the content offered on Netflix.
